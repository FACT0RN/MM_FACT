MM trading bot for FACT0RN.

**Disclaimer:** The goal of this app is **to fill up the order book with orders** NOT to make profit. This bot is NOT designed to be profitable.

What is the strategy?
  1. Allocate given USDT budget into buy orders.
  2. Allcoate given coin budget into Sell orders.
  3. It does this evenly, best results are when both USDT/Coin dollar value is about the same.
  4. The actual price points are a uniform distribution in the given spread.

You may also place buy and sell orders directly from here instead of the exchange. Just a bonus feature.

We are very much open to improvements and new algorithms to be incorparated. For now this only works with MXC.
